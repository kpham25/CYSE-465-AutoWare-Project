# CYSE-465-AutoWare-Project

##### Meeting for 11/12/2022

Tasks for upcoming meeting on 11/15/2022:

- Conduct further testing on Autoware and become more comfortable with a software, testing out different multi-car scenarios to observe how the car behaves and also to see what changes to the scenario will cause a change in the behavior for the vehicle.

- Attempt to work with unity engine editor to observe how feasible the traffic cone implementation

- If traffic cone implementation is feasible, test traffic cone affects with the benign and attack case

- Document all work of each member by opening up their own github and team also separate team github to document meetings and progress

###### Meeting for 11/15/2022

- Progress follow up:
  
  - Successful cone insertion into the Unity editor, although issues involving its placement within the simulation exist, further testing will need to be done
  
  - Majority of team members have worked with/ played with the simulator
  
  - Future direction of the project is discussed, involving what methods of attack will want to be tested (placing multi-car simulation to test if there is a possible way to trigger un-wanted behavior in a vehicle or implementing of attack cone to trigger unwanted vehicle behaviors)
  
  - Designate tasks for team members to focus and complete to work over the next week and during break
